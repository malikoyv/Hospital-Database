# Hospital Database
This project was created for the end of the semester at my academy.
The paths (database.txt && historyOfVisits.txt) were set on my PC, so you will need to change it (even ruthlessly).
## Setup
1. Download files from the repository.
2. Install and/or open your IDE or text editor (Word is the best IDE btw).
3. Change the paths in the code on your own.
4. Run the project in an external console.
## How to use
1. Start by choosing an option "log in" or "sign up".
2. You can view your information, schedule a doctor visit, see your visits history, or quit the program using any character except numbers (1-3).
3. In the visit schedule, you can choose a time you like, and the program will automatically find a doctor available at that time (if the time exists, it will be deleted in the next iteration).
## Thank you for your interest and good use!
