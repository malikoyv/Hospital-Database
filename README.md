# Hospital Database
Welcome to the Hospital Database project, designed for the culmination of the semester at my university. This robust system facilitates efficient management of patient data and visit histories.

## Setup
**1. Clone this repository:** \
`git clone https://github.com/malikoyv/Hospital-Database` \
**2. Configure Paths:** Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor. Adjust the file paths in the code to suit your system configuration.\
**3. Run the Project:** Execute the project in an external console environment.

## How to Use
**1. Login or Sign Up:** Begin by selecting either "log in" or "sign up" to access the system.\
**2. Explore Options:** Navigate through various functionalities such as viewing personal information, scheduling doctor visits, accessing visit history, or exiting the program. Use any character except numbers (1-3) for navigation.\
**3. Schedule Doctor Visit:** When scheduling a visit, choose your preferred time. The system automatically matches you with an available doctor for that slot. If the time slot is unavailable, it will be removed in subsequent iterations.

## Thank You!
Thank you for your interest in our Hospital Database project. We trust it will serve you well in efficiently managing patient data and visit schedules. Enjoy using it!
